Initial values: a = 1, b = 2

Post-increment:
After c = a++; c = 1, a = 2

Pre-increment:
After d = ++b; d = 3, b = 3

Initial values: x = 10, y = 10

Post-decrement:
After p = x--; p = 10, x = 9

Pre-decrement:

Initial num = 10

After num += 5 → num = 15
After num -= 3 → num = 12
After num *= 3 → num = 36
After num /= 4 → num = 9
After num %= 3 → num = 0
